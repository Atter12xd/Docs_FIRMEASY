## Patterns

**Common patterns for digital signature and document management interfaces.**  
This section outlines common patterns that facilitate the creation of intuitive and secure user interfaces for a digital signature and document management platform like Firmeasy.

---

## 1. Document Management Patterns
 
### Document Upload: 
Interfaces for uploading documents with drag-and-drop options, document preview, and file size/format checks. 

### Document Viewer:
A document viewer that allows users to review and scroll through multiple pages before signing.
### Version Control: 
Enables users to view different versions of a document, which is useful when there are multiple revisions or edits.

---

## 2. Signature Workflow Patterns

 ### Signature Request Flow: 
A flow that guides users through the signature request process, from selecting signers to final confirmation.
 ### Multi-Signature Support:
Allows multiple users to sign a document in different areas, either sequentially or simultaneously.
 ### Signature Positioning: 
Pattern for placing signatures in specific locations within the document, using options like drag-and-drop or field selection.

---

## 3. Authentication and Security Patterns

- ### Two-Factor Authentication (2FA): 
Adds an extra layer of security for users when logging in or confirming a signature.
- ### Audit Trail: 
An audit history that displays all actions taken on a document (upload, sign, download) to maintain transparency.
- ### Access Control: 
Defines specific permissions for each user or role concerning a document (view, edit, sign, download).

---

## 4. User Feedback and Notifications Patterns

- ### Real-Time Status Updates: 
Real-time notifications that display the status of the signature process (pending, signed, rejected).
- ### Email Notifications: 
Automatic emails informing users about signature requests, process completion, or reminders.
- ### Error Handling:
 Clear messages for error cases, such as issues with file format or failed authentication.

---

## 5. Data Privacy and Compliance Patterns

- ### Consent Forms: 
Allows the inclusion of consent forms that users must accept before signing.
- ### Encryption Indicators: 
Shows users that documents are encrypted and compliant with local regulations.
- ### GDPR/CCPA Compliance: 
Ensures that user data is managed in accordance with privacy laws, with options for users to request the deletion of their data.

These patterns not only enhance the user experience on a digital signature platform but also provide transparency and compliance with legal standards. Each pattern includes a brief description, implementation examples, and usage recommendations, making it useful for developers and advanced users seeking to understand the platformâ€™s workflow.
